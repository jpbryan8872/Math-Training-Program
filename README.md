# Math Training Program
The Math Training Program challenges the user to quickly complete arithmetic calculations. I created tihs project my second semester at Florida Gulf Coast University during the COP 1500 Introduction to Computer Science course. Through this project I honed my skills programming in Python. This program was created to both complete our final integration project as well as be used to help my little brothers learn math.
